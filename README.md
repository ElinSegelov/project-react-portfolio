# React Portfolio
For week nine of the Technigo bootcamp our assignment was to remake the portfolio (project of week three) with React, using styled components. Data about projects should be displayed from a json-file.

## The problem
I copied my html and css from the previous portfolio and I created main components for each section of the page and then split those up in smaller components. Date about the projects I have created are fetched from GitHubs API and for the "Thoughts section" I created a json file to inport the data from. This was my first time using styled components and I think it would have been better to start from scratch to me able to create reusable styled components. I had several reusable classes in the css but incorporating that in the styled components probably took more time than it would have if I had started over.
